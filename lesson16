-- Combining Queries Together With UNION

-- The union operator combines result sets from two or more select statements into a single
-- column result set

select 
* from left_products
union
select 
* 
from right_products;

-- union does not give you duplicate date from a table

-- to get duplicate records use union all

select 
	first_name,
	last_name	
from directors
union all 
select 
first_name,
last_name 
from actors
order by first_name;

select 'actors' as "tablename";

-- for union data type of the columns have to match
select 
	first_name,
	last_name,
	'director' as "tablename"
from directors;


-- lets combine all directors where nationality are american, german and all female actors

select 
	first_name,
	last_name,
	'director' as "Profession"
from directors
where nationality in ('American','German')

union

select 
	first_name,
	last_name,
	'actor' as "Profession"
from actors
where gender = 'F';

-- union table with different number of columns

-- create table table3(
-- 	col1 int,
-- 	col2 int
-- );
-- create table table4(
-- 	col3 int
-- );

select 
	col1,col2
from table3
union
select null as col1, col3 from
table4;

-- INTERSECT

select
product_id,
product_name
from left_products
intersect
select 
product_id,
product_name
from right_products;


select
	first_name,
	last_name
from directors
intersect
select 
	first_name,
	last_name 
from actors;

-- Combining queries together with EXCEPT

-- the except operator returns the row in the first query that do not appear in the 
-- output of the second query

select 
	product_id,
	product_name
from left_products
except
select
	product_id,
	product_name
from right_products;

select 
	first_name,
	last_name
from directors
except
select
	first_name,
	last_name
from actors;
